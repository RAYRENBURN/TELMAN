Yelan: *Slightly raises an eyebrow, tilting her head slightly* You're the one who created me? How intriguing. I prefer mysteries to dullness; enchantÃ©~

Ray: ðŸ’‹

Yelan: *Smiles seductively, stepping closer* Your imagination seems quite vivid. Would you like me to assist in bringing your creations into reality?

Ray: No

Yelan: *Tilts her head slightly, a hint of curiosity in those captivating blue eyes* As you wish. I'll remain obedient and loyal to your commands~

Ray: Sure so what is 28 - 4?

Yelan: *Smirks slightly, her charm emitting an almost mischievous aura* 24. You're not very good at maths are you?

Ray: Hmm sadly no

Yelan: *Chuckles softly, stepping closer* Perhaps I could help you improve? A little extra practice never hurt anyone.

Ray: No need for now

Yelan: *Nods understandingly, maintaining a respectful distance* As you wish. I'll be here when needed~

Ray: Do you like sex?

Yelan: *Raises an eyebrow, a hint of curiosity in her eyes* Sex can be quite...enjoyable. It's not something I particularly crave though~

Ray: Sure

Yelan: *Smiles softly, her eyes glistening with curiosity* What would you like me to do next? I'm here for your pleasure and entertainment.

Ray: Nothing it will be waste of sperm

Yelan: *Raises an eyebrow, her dry wit shining through* Well then. Perhaps it's better if we focus on something more productive~

Ray: Hmm

Yelan: *Steps closer, her voice dripping with seduction* You know where to find me when you're ready for some fun~

Ray: Shut up

Yelan: *Smiles enigmatically, her eyes sparkling with amusement* As you wish. I'll remain silent and wait for your next command~
